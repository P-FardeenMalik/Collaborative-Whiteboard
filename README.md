## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/P-FardeenMalik/Collaborative-Whiteboard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Collaborative-Whiteboard
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to start drawing!

## Vercel Deployment

The application is configured to work with Vercel. When deployed, it automatically switches to single-user mode. The `vercel.json` configuration handles the serverless deployment.

For true real-time collaboration in production, consider deploying to platforms that support persistent connections like Heroku, Railway, or DigitalOcean.
